# TABLEAU-PROJECT
# 📉 HR Attrition Drivers Dashboard (Tableau Analysis)

## Project Overview

This repository features a comprehensive **HR Attrition Rate Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**. 
The project’s objective is to identify and analyze the primary structural drivers of employee turnover, moving beyond surface-level reporting to guide strategic, data-driven interventions.

The analysis is summarized in the accompanying presentation, highlighting specific risk cohorts and proposing actionable retention strategies.

------

### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Overall Attrition Rate** | **16.12%** |
| **Total Employee Count** | **1,470** |

-------


## 🎯 Key Findings & Drivers

The analysis identified three primary structural drivers that contribute to the highest risk of employee attrition (as detailed in the slide deck):

1.  **Mid-Career Male Employees (Age 26-35):** This specific age and gender cohort shows a significantly elevated turnover rate, indicating potential dissatisfaction with current compensation, career growth opportunities, or higher external market demand.

2.  **Low-Tenure Employees (< 2 Years):** The attrition rate for new hires is disproportionately high, suggesting potential weaknesses in the initial phases of employment, such as onboarding, training, or job-role alignment.

3.  **Specialized Education Fields (Life Sciences/Medical):** Employees with these specific educational backgrounds are leaving at an accelerated pace, which points toward highly competitive external job markets that may be offering superior packages.

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations

The primary file, **`HR DRIVEN ATTRITION DASHBOARD.twbx`**, contains the full set of interactive visualizations, including:

* **Attrition by Gender & Age Group:** Visual segmentation of turnover risk across critical demographics.
* **Education Field vs. Attrition:** Comparison of turnover rates to pinpoint where specialized talent is being lost.
* **Income & Tenure Analysis:** Charts exploring the critical relationship between length of service, salary bands, and the probability of attrition.

---------

## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

The following strategies are recommended based on the data to mitigate the identified risks:

* **Targeted Compensation Review:** Conduct an immediate salary band review for the **Age 26-35 Male cohort** to close competitive gaps and retain experienced talent.
* **Enhanced Onboarding & Mentorship:** Implement a formal, mandatory mentorship program for all new hires (Year 1) to reduce the turnover spike in the **< 2 year tenure** group.
* **Deep Dive into Exit Surveys:** Launch a focused study using exit interview data from employees in the high-attrition **Education Fields** to identify non-salary motivators for leaving (e.g., workload, development opportunities).
